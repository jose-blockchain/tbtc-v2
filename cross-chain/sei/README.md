# tBTC Sei Network Integration - Canonical L2TBTC

## Overview

This directory contains the canonical L2TBTC implementation for Sei Network, enabling native Bitcoin-backed tokens with secure cross-chain functionality. The implementation follows the standard tBTC v2 canonical pattern with upgradeable contracts and comprehensive access controls.

### Why This Approach is Better

#### **Canonical Purity**
- **Zero modifications** to proven L2TBTC contract
- **No custom interfaces** or bridge-specific functions
- **Standard ownership** and minter management
- **Battle-tested** canonical behavior preserved

#### **Bitcoin-Backed Native Tokens**
- **Direct Bitcoin backing** via L1 vault (not hub-and-spoke)
- **Native Sei tokens** backed by real Bitcoin custody
- **No liquidity pools** or wrapped token complexity
- **True multichain Bitcoin** with enhanced security

#### **Manual Deployment Advantages**
- **Full control** over deployment process
- **Custom rate limits** for Bitcoin-specific use cases
- **Tailored security** parameters for high-value assets
- **No dependency** on standard CLI tools designed for generic tokens

## Contract Details

### Core Functions

```solidity
// Minter management
function addMinter(address minter) external onlyOwner
function removeMinter(address minter) external onlyOwner
function getMinters() external view returns (address[] memory)

// Guardian management
function addGuardian(address guardian) external onlyOwner
function removeGuardian(address guardian) external onlyOwner
function getGuardians() external view returns (address[] memory)

// Token operations
function mint(address account, uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused onlyMinter
function burn(uint256 amount) public override whenNotPaused
function burnFrom(address account, uint256 amount) public override whenNotPaused

// Emergency controls
function pause() external onlyGuardian
function unpause() external onlyOwner

// Recovery functions
function recoverERC20(IERC20Upgradeable token, address recipient, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner
function recoverERC721(IERC721Upgradeable token, address recipient, uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external onlyOwner
```

### Canonical Features

- **Full canonical L2TBTC implementation** with complete compliance
- `addMinter/removeMinter` interface for bridge authorization
- Guardian system for emergency controls
- Pausable functionality for risk management
- EIP2612 permit support for gasless operations
- Upgradeable architecture with TransparentUpgradeableProxy
- ERC20Burnable with burnFrom functionality
- Owner-controlled access management

## Deployment Process

### 1. Setup Encrypted Private Key

```bash
# Setup secure key management
npm run setup-key
```

### 2. Deploy L2TBTC on Sei Testnet

```bash
# Deploy with encrypted private key
npm run deploy:encrypted
```

### 3. Verify Contracts

```bash
# Verify proxy contract
npm run verify:sei <PROXY_ADDRESS>

# Verify implementation contract
npm run verify:sei <IMPLEMENTATION_ADDRESS>
```

### 4. Configure Bridge Minters

```bash
# Add bridge as minter (example)
cast send $PROXY_ADDRESS \
  "addMinter(address)" $BRIDGE_ADDRESS \
  --rpc-url https://evm-rpc-testnet.sei-apis.com \
  --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

## Integration with Cross-Chain Bridges

### Flow Diagram

```
Bitcoin Deposit â†’ Ethereum L1 â†’ Bridge â†’ Sei Network
     â†“              â†“              â†“              â†“
Real Bitcoin â†’ L1 tBTC Mint â†’ Bridge Message â†’ Native Sei tBTC
```

### Bridge Integration Points

1. **Bridge Contract**: Must be added as minter via `addMinter()`
2. **Minting Authority**: Only authorized minters can mint tokens
3. **Emergency Controls**: Guardians can pause during incidents
4. **Upgrade Path**: Owner can upgrade implementation if needed

### Bitcoin-Backed Flow

```
Bitcoin Deposit â†’ Ethereum L1 â†’ Bridge â†’ Sei Network
     â†“              â†“              â†“              â†“
Real Bitcoin â†’ L1 tBTC Mint â†’ Bridge Message â†’ Native Sei tBTC
   (Vault)       (Canonical)    (Enhanced)     (Pure L2TBTC)
```

## Security Considerations

### Access Controls
- **Owner**: Can add/remove minters and guardians, upgrade contracts
- **Guardians**: Can pause contract during emergencies
- **Minters**: Only authorized bridges can mint new tokens

### Emergency Procedures
```solidity
// Guardian can pause all operations
contract.pause()

// Owner can remove compromised minter
contract.removeMinter(compromisedMinter)

// Owner can upgrade implementation
upgradeTo(newImplementation)
```

### Upgrade Safety
- TransparentUpgradeableProxy ensures upgrade safety
- Implementation can be upgraded while preserving state
- Admin controls upgrade process

## Benefits Over Complex Interface Approach

| Aspect | Canonical Approach | Interface Approach |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Complexity** | Simple | Complex |
| **Security** | Proven canonical code | Custom modifications |
| **Maintenance** | Standard upgrades | Custom upgrade paths |
| **Tooling** | Works with all L2TBTC tools | May break tooling |
| **Deployment** | Manual control | CLI dependency |
| **Bitcoin Focus** | Optimized for Bitcoin | Generic token approach |

## Why This is Perfect for tBTC

1. **Bitcoin-Backed**: Real Bitcoin custody, not wrapped tokens
2. **Native Experience**: Full DeFi composability on Sei
3. **Enhanced Security**: Bridge + Bitcoin vault backing
4. **Canonical Purity**: Zero risk from custom modifications
5. **Manual Control**: Bitcoin-appropriate deployment and configuration

This approach gives you **true Bitcoin-backed native tokens** with **enterprise-grade security** while maintaining **100% canonical compatibility**.
